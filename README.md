# BTC-Puzzle-66
My progress with puzzle 66 bit using Vanitysearch .
All The txt files contains adresses that simillar to the target address of the puzzle 66 bit .
The closeist address that has the first 10 characters of the address is this :
13zb1hQbWVVmXW3vBrEcXQSNmsvrpRueot  2000008268DD7159C

The last i got in this list is this : 13zb1hQwvpFVFBPWfsLxrNwTjg3vFWMd6d  20001D4BE83A0B847 
but the last i got that has 9 characters is : 
13zb1hQbWKaTmVtxB7VjrvPCaD1iH8Ms7g   2000217503C919D0C
but now i reached :  2000277503C919D08
searching for the first 9 characters doesn't give alot of address to save 
good luck hunting
